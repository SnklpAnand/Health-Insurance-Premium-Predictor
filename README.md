## Situation
Insurance premium calculations were inconsistent because rule-based methods could not accurately capture the impact of customer age, income, lifestyle, and medical history.

## Task
I was responsible for building a machine learning model to predict annual insurance premiums more accurately and make it usable through a simple application.

## Action
- Cleaned and prepared the data, handled missing values, and treated outliers.
- Created new features such as a medical risk score from health history.
- Trained and compared multiple regression models, including Linear, Ridge, and XGBoost.
- Tuned the best model and deployed it using a Streamlit web app.

## Result
- Improved prediction accuracy significantly, with XGBoost reducing error compared to linear models.
- Delivered a working, easy-to-use application for real-time premium prediction
